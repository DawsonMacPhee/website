                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The Java Handbook is one of my oldest projects, and is meant to be used while coding in
                                    Java. The idea is that as I learn the language, I add pages to the program as a form of note taking.
                                    That way when I'm coding, I have this program open to easily reference the syntax and usage of a native method. Since
                                    its creation, I have continuously added to the program and still update it to this day.

                                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The app is, of course, programmed with Java. Java is my most confident programming 
                                        language and this app has been a really good learning experience for me. It's creation offered me 
                                        valuable practise with JSwing GUI components. In addition to Java, this app also gave me my first experience 
                                        with HTML. The text displayed is styled with HTML within a JEditorPane. This is definetly one of 
                                        my most used and most useful apps.

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">At the start of my second year of university, I started working with a friend of mine on a plugin for 
                                    one of our favourite games; Minecraft. We decided we would make use of the Java Spigot API to build a plugin for a minigame to be 
                                    run on a public server. The game is a recreation of an old mingame that I used to play alot when I was younger. The plugin turned 
                                    out to be alot more complex than we orginially thought it would be, but works very well and is currently being hosted on our 
                                    own public server.

                                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The plugin was written in Java and used multiple APIs; most notably of which is the Spigot API 
                                        which is what we used to interface with Minecraft in order to alter the game's function. The other APIs we used were extensions of Spigot
                                        allowing us to further modify the game mechanics. We had to learn how to use these APIs 
                                        as neither of us had used them before. The project is organized and built using Maven with versioning and merges between the 
                                        two of us handled by GitHub. The source files are available for viewing on my friend's GitHub; Ethan Gervais.

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">During my first year of university, I began a project with a highschool friend of mine in which we designed
                                    and built a mobile minigame. I was responsible for the coding and my friend created the graphics. We ended up building a simple 2d side-scroller
                                    about guiding a space ship through a maze; it's called Cosmic Crash. The game includes a realistic physics engine as well as integrated ad slots.

                                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">This game was created using the Unity Engine and their C# scripting API. The Unity Engine was used to handle level design 
                                        while Unity scripts built in C# are used to add function to the game environment. The ads are handled through Unity's own ads service and are controlled 
                                        via more C# scripts. Since it's built in Unity, it can be published on both IOS and Android platforms. Our early testing has been exclusivly in IOS, giving 
                                        me experience in using XCode and testing applications on Apple products.

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The Python Handbook is equivalent to the Java Handbook, but for Python. 
                                    I find it very nice to have programs like this that give me quick refreshers on syntax and modules. The 
                                    Python Handbook is in it's infancy stages; there is still alot more to add as I become more comfortable 
                                    with the Python Language.

                                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The Python Handbook is coded in Python, using primarily the Tkinter module, with a
                                        little of the extended ttk module worked in. When Python was a fairly new language to me, I started by learning basic
                                        syntax, then immediatly begun the process of creating the handbook to log my progress. The version included below
                                        is new and refreshed as of August 2019. I restarted from scratch after realising that I could restructure the original 
                                        to make it easier to read and maintain. Currently, the only inlcuded modules are Tkinter and layout managing information, 
                                        however I'm working to add other modules I use often, such as Raspberry Pi GPIO and Socket Servers.

                                    realizing that I had nothing to do. I set off to learn something new by starting a project with 
                                    the intention of challenging myself. In trying to find something to create that was different from 
                                    other projects I've done, I realized that I had amassed a folder full of finished projects that I wasn't doing 
                                    anything with. I figured that it was time to publish some of my best works, and this website is the result.

                                        Before this website, I had a very rudementary knowledge of HTML from creating The Java Handbook. Yet, that was just extremely simple bolding, 
                                        font size, and emphasis tags. During the planning of this website, I made it my mission to learn not only more about HTML, 
                                        but to also learn CSS and JavaScript to make things look more aesthetically pleasing. I could not be happier with the results. I bought 
                                        the domain in 2018 and being the perfectionist I am, I rebuilt the entire thing from the ground up in 2019 as I learned more
                                        advanced stylings in the markup languages. The site is hosted through GH Pages on GitHub, and the sourcefiles can be viewed there.

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">During the 2020 Fall semester, I took a course called Data Structures which explored many different ways 
                                    of storing data within programming langauges. For the final project of this course, we were asked to make use of the structures we had discussed 
                                    in order to create a statistical AI that can play TicTacToe. I really enjoyed the content we learned, and at the end of the semester, I had acheived a 100% 
                                    average in the course.

                                        written by me. I generated all possible variants of a tictactoe board, and made use of a tree structure to store them (by linking the possible moves available from each board). 
                                        From there, I worked through each board and assigned a score for all of x's turns and o's turns. When playing the game, the AI will generate the scores and use them to 
                                        select which move to make (which board to branch to). This AI is very effective, and in my testing appears to be unbeatable.

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">This was an assignment for the Fall 2020 Data Structures course. Our task was to use hashtables to create a database of information 
                                    from the IMDB movie database. These hashtables were then used to create a series of searching functions relating to actors and movies. The programs take input from a specific 
                                    file format created by my professor and generates hashtable files that match keys and values for faster references.
                                </p>

                                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">This program is written in C and makes use of a hashtable library from another assignment. There are multiple programs included. 
                                        One of them is responsible for generating the hashtables and outputing them to files, while the rest of the programs are responsible for performing searches 
                                        on the generated files. Internally, each actor and movie is assigned a key value and the keys are mapped to eachother which creates connections between actors 
                                        and the movies they appeared in.

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">This is a collection of libraries that I wrote for the Fall 2020 Data Structures course. Each assignment in the course was centered around writing a
                                    library of functions for manipulating a specific data structure. During the 5 assignments in the course, we covered pointer/byte/bit manipulation, arrays, linked lists, trees, 
                                    and hashtables. The test files included were written by my professor, but the functions within the libraries were written by myself.
                                </p>
                                <div class="expandCard">
                                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">All the libraries were written in C; the language chosen for the course. Since C does not implement data structures natively, these libraries 
                                        are actually quite useful in the programming of C applications. Each library contains functions for creation, deletion, adding/removing elements, sorting elements, and 
                                        searching for elements.
